# Welcome!

Hello everyone and welcome to the documentation page for the GORELLA base
skeleton, we're glad to see you here!
For more information on the GORELLA project see
[here](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_overview/).

Within these pages, we provide the basic elements needed to implement the
GORELLA framework.

## What's all this now?

GORELLA stands for "Generalizable Outline for Realistic Empirical Life
Science Lectures and their Applications".

## I've got a question!

In case you have any questions or difficulties applying the GORELLA framework
to your project, please donâ€™t hesitate a single second to get in touch with
us. A great way to do this is to
[open an issue](https://github.com/G0RELLA/gorella_base/issues) on the
GitHub site of the GORELLA base skeleton.
We would also highly appreciate and value every feedback or idea or you
might have.
